Maven

CI/CD
CI = Continuous Integration
CD = Continuous Deployment or Delivery

What is continuous integration?
When developers are working on a project, they write the code, then build, test, push to version control system, monitor the entire process continuously

Version Control System (VCS) examples = GitHub, GitLab, Perforce, Subversion

Maven commands
Example: $ mvn package

clean — delete target directory
validate — validate, if the project is correct
compile — compile source code, classes stored in target/classes
test — run tests
package — take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, e.g. JAR, WAR
verify — run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria
install — install the package into the local repository
deploy — copies the final package to the remote repository

Java based standalone applications are deployed using $java -jar app.jar

java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=<your port>
