Introduction to Observability - Datadog
- Monitoring is the act of paying attention to the patterns that your metrics are telling you. It's about analyzing your data and acting on it.
- Observability is taking the same data you've collected, and moving beyond "What is happening?" to "Why is it happening?"
Pillars of Observability
1. Metrics: these data points are numerical vallues that can track anything about our environment over time.
2. Logs: Computer generated file that contains time stamped information about usage of that system.
3. Traces: used to track the time spent by an application processing a request and the status of this request.

SLO - Service Level objective
APM - Application Performance Monitoring

















Writing custom checks
* The datadog agent is written in go language. If you want to create your own checks, you can write them in python. 
* Do NOT install a module with the default pip installed on a Linux server as the datadog agent has it's own python environment. You will need to use the pip in the embedded directory of the datadog agent.
