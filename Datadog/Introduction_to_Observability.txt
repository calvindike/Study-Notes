Introduction to Observability - Datadog
- Monitoring is the act of paying attention to the patterns that your metrics are telling you. It's about analyzing your data and acting on it.
- Observability is taking the same data you've collected, and moving beyond "What is happening?" to "Why is it happening?"
Pillars of Observability
1. Metrics: these data points are numerical vallues that can track anything about our environment over time.
2. Logs: Computer generated file that contains time stamped information about usage of that system.
3. Traces: used to track the time spent by an application processing a request and the status of this request.
   The individual steps in traces are called spans. There are multiple spans in a trace.

Datadog helps tie our metrics, traces, and logs together which makes monitoring or troubleshooting easier.


SLO - Service Level objective
APM - Application Performance Monitoring



=============================================================

There are three tags that the Agent will look for to help identify services:

service: the name of the services, such as store-ads
env: the environment in which the services is running. For example, production, internal, foundation-lab
version: a number such as 1 or 1.2.3















Writing custom checks
* The datadog agent is written in go language. If you want to create your own checks, you can write them in python. 
* Do NOT install a module with the default pip installed on a Linux server as the datadog agent has it's own python environment. You will need to use the pip in the embedded directory of the datadog agent.
