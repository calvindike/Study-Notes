Kubernetes Installation and Configuration Fundamentals - Anthony Nocentino

What is Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a container orchestrator: It starts and stops containers based on the configuration given to it. It also provides infrastructure abstraction which means we tell it what we want and it handles it for us as well as keeping the desired state we want by actively monitoring the containers and changing changing things when needed.

Benefits of K8s
- speed of deployment
- ability to absorb change quickly
- ability to recover quickly (when observed state is different from desired state)
- allow us hide infra complexity in the cluster (developers don't need to worry about a lot when deploying applications)

Kubernetes Principles
- Desired State/Declarative Configuration
- Controllers/Control Loops: constantly monitor and make changes to systems to make sure it's in desired state
- Kubernetes API/API Server: provides a collection of objects that we can use to deploy in code
API objects like pods, controllers, services, and nodes allow us to configure the state of the system declaratively and imperatively.
API server is a Restful API over HTTP using JSON and is the way we interact with our cluster. This is also the only way Kubernetes interacts with our cluster. 

Pods 
A construct that represent one or more containers. This is pretty much our application or service and is the most basic unit of work. Pods are ephemeral and as such, are never redeployed instead, a new pod will be deployed to provide the services the old pod was running. Kubernetes tracks the state of our pods to make sure everything is healthy. It uses probes to do these health checks.

Controllers
Defines our desired state as well as create and manage pods for us. Controllers monitor and respond to the health states of pods according to the result of the probes.
ReplicaSet
This controller allows us to define the number of replicas of a pod we want running at all times.
We will usually create a Deployment instead of a ReplicaSet when deploying an application as a Deployment covers the ReplicaSet configuration and helps us manage rollouts and rollbacks of these ReplicaSets.

Services
These add persistency to our ephemeral world. It helps with network abstraction for pod access, PI and DNS name for the service and is dynamically updated based on the Pod cycle. Serviecs are scaled by adding/removing pods.

* Persistent volume is a pod independent storage. The pod claims this storage that we have configured/set from the cluster.

Cluster components
control plane node: leader
node: worker
Each node in a cluster contributes to the compute capacity of the cluster. Nodes can either be virtual or physical machines.

Components of control plane node
- API server: communication hub of our cluster. This is stateless.
This is central to the control of our cluster. It validates any config coming to the cluster.
- Cluster store(etcd): persists the state of our objects using key-value parirs
- Scheduler: tells K8s which nodes to start pods on based on administrative policies or available resources
Watches API server, schedule pods, resources, and respects constraints.
- Controller Manager: implements lifecycle functions of the controllers that monitor the cluster. Pretty much in charge of desired state
Executes controller loops, watch and update the API server and makes sure correct number of pods or replica sets are running.


Node
This is where our applications run. We can have as many nodes as possible.
Components of nodes
- Kubelet: monitors API server for changes and is responsible for pod lifecycle. This reports Node and Pod state
- kube-proxy: has the responsibility to implement services, route traffic to pods, and load balance.
- Container runtime: resoinsible for downloading images and run containers. Default is containerd but there are many others you can use. Docker used to be the container runtime but was changed in v1.2
These will also run on the control plane nodes, not just the worker nodes.
Kubelet and kube-proxy communicate directly with the API server.

Cluster Add-on Pods
Pods that provide special services to the pod
DNS: uses Core DNS to provide DNS services to the pod
Ingress controllers: for HTTP or layer7 loadbalancer
Dashboard: for web based administration of cluster
Overlays:

Pod Operations
We use kubectl to submit code to Kubernetes via the API server which stores the information in etcd. Scheduler schedules, and controller manager monitors the state after the kubelet receives work from the API server. Control plane nodes will usually only run pods that are system pods.
*Personal note - You can look at things from a node level or from a cluster level.

Kubernetes Networking Requirements
1. Pods on a Node can communicate with all Pods on all Nodes without Network Address Translation (NAT)
2. Agents on a Node can communicate with all Pods on that Node.
In summary, all pods and nodes should be able to connect or talk to each other with the IP addresses they have.

Installation methods:
- Desktop
- Kubeadm
- Cloud Scenarios

Cluster Network Ports
Component		Ports(TCP)	Used By
API 			 6443		All
etcd 			 2379-2380	API/etcd
Scheduler		 10251		Self
Controller Manager	 10252		Self
Kubelet			 10250		Control Plane
NodePort Service	 30000-32767	All


- Install container runtime --> # apt-get install -y containerd
- Add gpg key
- Add Kubernetes repository
- Install packages needed --> # apt-get install kubelet kubeadm kubectl
- Hold packages so apt does NOT aitomatically patch these when applying security updates --> # apt-mark hold  kubelet kubeadm kubectl containerd

Specs:
2 vCPU
2GB RAM
100GB
Swap disabled
Hostnames set on all nodes to not rely on DNS (testing)

--- Installing Kubeadm on Control Plane ---
SSH to Control node and run following comands
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/master/manifests/calico.yaml (download calico manifest)
$ vi calico.yml
CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR - change this to your network or leave default
$ sudo kubeadm init --kubernetes-version v1.29.1 (initialize kubernetes and generate needed config files in /etc/kubernetes) To use latest, remove --kubernetes-version from command
Run any other commands listed after initialization
$ kubectl apply -f calico.yml
$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --watch
$ kubectl get nodes
$ sudo systemctl status kubelet.service (should be active and running)


Kubectl common operations 
*https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/#operations
- apply/create: create resources
- run: start a pod from an image
- explain: documentation of resources
- delete: delete resource(s)
- get: list resources
- describe: show detailed resource information
- exec: execute a command on a container (like docker exec -it)
- logs: view logs on a container

Kubernetes services also have aliases eg: nodes(no), pods(po), services(svc)

Kubectl output format
*https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/#output-options
wide - output additional info
yaml - YAML formatted API object
json - JSOn formatted API object
dry-run - print an object without sending it to the API server

kubectl <command> <type> <name> <flags>
kubectl   get 	   pods   pod1   --output=yaml
kubectl create deployment nginx  --image=nginx

For Kubectl autocompletion
# echo 'source <(kubectl completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

# kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system (get system pods)
# kubectl api-resources | more (list all api resources)

We can use the --dry-run option to create a manifest file from an imperative kubectl command
FROM (imperative)
# kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=gcr.io/google-sammples/hello-app:1.0
TO (create manifest)
# kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=gcr.io/google-sammples/hello-app:1.0 --dry-run=client -o yaml > hello-deploy.yml
TO (Manifest)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: hello-world
  name: hello-world
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-world
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: hello-world
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/google-sammples/hello-app:1.0
        name: hello-app
        resources: {}
status: {}

---Application Deployment Process---
When we run 'kubectl apply <deployment>'
- Kubectl sends our request to tht APi Server
- API server looks at the information in the deployment manifest, and stores the objects in etcd
- Controller Manager which is watching for any new objects will startup a controller for the deployment which will start up a ReplicaSet
- ReplicaSet will create the number of Pods required for the Deployment and will write the information back to etcd
- Scheduler which is watching etcd to see if there are any Pods not assigned to nodes yet, will schedule/assign the Pods to nodes in the cluster which will be updated in etcd
- To start the Pods on the nodes, the Kubelets from the nodes asking the APi server if it has any work, will send a message to the Container Runtime once it finds Pods scheduled to be run on nodes to pull down the container images specified in our manifest to s=then start the Pods on nodes.
- If the Pod is a member of a Service, that Service is updated on the Kube-proxy on that node.

To get list of containers running on a node when using containerd
# crictl --runtime-endpoint unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock ps  (docker ps -a if using Docker)

# kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
# kubectl run hello-world-pod --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
#kubectl get pods
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
hello-world-7879445f4-wdcw5   1/1     Running   0             34s
hello-world-pod               1/1     Running   0             6s

<pod name>-<pod template hash>-<unique identifier>
In the first pod, the string 7879445f4 is known as the pod template hash from a deployment apart.

# kubectl logs hello-world-pod (look into pod logs)
# kubectl describe pod hello-world-pod (see more details about pod)
# kubectl describe deployment hello-world
# kubectl describe replicasets hello-world
# kubectl exec -it hello-world-pod -- /bin/sh (attach to container shell to run commands)


# kubectl expose deployment hello-world --port=80 --target-port=8080
Create a hello-world service that is listening on port 80 while the pod listens on port 8080
# kubectl expose deployment hello-world --port=80 --target-port=8080 --dry-run=client -o yaml | more
# kubectl edit deployments.apps hello-world (edit deployment/resource on the fly to reflect in etcd - this is not in our manifest which is NOT the best way to do it)
# kubectl scale deployment hello-world --replicas=40 (another way to edit deployment on the fly)




When you have multiple environments of kubernetes installed like cloud, kubeadm, minikube, docker-desktop, you will see them as contexts and you can change contexts to run commands against any of the environments.
# kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT   NAME             CLUSTER          AUTHINFO         NAMESPACE
*         docker-desktop   docker-desktop   docker-desktop
          minikube         minikube         minikube

# kubectl config use-context minikube (change context)

Managing the Kubernetes API Server and Pods

Using the Kubernetes API
Kubernetes API: a single surface area over the resources in our data center or cluster
API Objects: collection of primitives used by Kubernetes to represent the state of our cluster, which also enables configuration of state
API Server: the sole way to interact with our cluster and the sole way Kubernetes interacts with our cluster.

--- API Server ---
This is a client/server architecture that exchanges JSON objects over HTTP via a RESTFUL API.
Client submits request, Server responds. The API is stateless as nothing is stored on here but is stored on etcd (cluster store).

--- API Objects ---
Persistent entities that allow us to build and deploy in Kubernetes. These are organized in 3 ways;
1. Kind: string value representing the resource like Pods, Service, Deployment
2. API Group: a way to organize like objects together based on their function eg. core, apps, storage
3. API Version: defines the version schema of the representation of a particular object in the API server.

Imperative configuration: using the cmdline commands to change the state of our cluster
Declarative configuration: definint the desired state of our cluster in code inside a Manifest using languages like YAML, JSON
 kubectl apply -f <manifest> to apply the change from the Manifest

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx

https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/

--- Dry-run ---
Server-side dry-run is used when we want to make a request but not sure if the request is properly formatted. The request here will NOT be persisted in stoage but will be processed as a typical request. This is more of a test.
eg: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml --dry-run=server

Client-side dry-run will write the object to be created to stdout, validate manifest syntax, and is also great for generating syntactically correct YAMl manifests.
eg: kubectl create deployment nginx -image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml  (This will print the manifest from this command to stdout but can also be redireccted to a file using > filename.yaml)

--- Kubectl diff ---
Used to check the difference between the current state of the resource in our cluster and resources defined in our Manifest or stdin. This outputs the differences to stdout
eg: 
# kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml (with ReplicaSet of 3)
# kubectl scale --replicas=5 deployment nginx-deployment (increase ReplicaSet to 5 imperatively)
deployment.apps/nginx-deployment scaled

# kubectl diff -f newdeployment.yaml

--- API Groups ---
API Groups enable better organization of resources 
There is Core API group(Legacy Group) and Named API Groups
Core: Pod, Node, Namespace, PersistentVolume, PersistentVolumeClaim - These have been around since the inception of Kubernetes
Named: 
apps group: Deployment object
storage.k8s.io: StorageClass object
rbac.authorization.k8s.io: Role object

--- API Versioning ---
The APi is versioned at the APi level so we know what version we are interacting with in code. THis helps to provide stability for existing implementations as you can choose which AP version you want to interact with. They are also usually backwards compatible and also forward change so that we can specofy the APi version we want to work with in our code.
The versionsa also move through Alpha/Experimental -> Beta/Pre-release -> Stable/General Availability
# kubectl api-resources
# kubectl api-resources --api-group=apps


*Anatomy of an API Request 
When we enter a command, that yaml command will be transformed to JSON and sent to the API server. If request is to get something, the informatin will come from the cluster store but if it is to deploy, the information will be stored in the cluster store before being sent out by the scheduler and controller.

RESTful API Verbs
GET: get data from a specified resource(s)
POST: create a resource
DELETE: delete a resource
PUT: create or update entire existing resource
PATCH: modify the specified fields or elements of a resource

Special API Requests
LOG: retrieve logs from a container in a Pod
EXEC: exec a command in a container, get the output
WATCH: change notifications on a resource with streaming output

API Resource Location(API Paths)
Core API(Legacy): http://apiserver:port/api/$VERSION/$RESOURCE_TYPE
                  http://apiserver:port/api/$VERSION/namespaces/$NAMESPACE/$RESOURCE_TYPE/$RESOURCE_NAME

API Groups: http://apiserver:port/apis/$GROUPNAME/$VERSION/$RESOURCE_TYPE
            http://apiserver:port/apis/$GROUPNAME/$VERSION/namespaces/$NAMESPACE/$RESOURCE_TYPE/$RESOURCE_NAME

Response Codes from API server (these are based on what happened in the APi based on our request)
Success (2xx)
200 = OK
201 = Created
202 = Accepted

Client Errors (4xx)
401 = Unauthorized
403 = Access Denied
404 = Resource Not Found

Server Errors (5xx)
500 = Internal Server Error

In looking at the lifecycle of an API request from a client to a Server, we have the Connection -> Authentication -> Authorization -> Admission Control 
Connection: can we make connection to the API server (http over TCP and TLS Encrypted)
Authentication: are you a valid user?
Authorization: can you perform the requested action. In Kubernetes, access is denied by default, then allowed when a user has been assigned permissions to a particular resource ie default deny.
Admission Control: gives us admin control over a request. The request passes through Admission controller which could modify or reject a request. Object being requested is also validated here.

# kubectl get pod hello-world -v 6 (increase verbosity which will show us the api path, response code, and how long the request took)
Verbosity can be increased from 6 upwards to get additional information including headers.
# kubectl proxy & 
# curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/hello-world | head -n 20
# fg
ctrl+c
# kubectl logs hello-world -v 6


Managing Objects with Labels, Annotations, and Namespaces
To organize objects in Kubernetes, we use 3 primary methods
- Namespaces: used when we want to put a boundary around a resource in terms of security, naming, or resource allocation.
This gives us the ability to subdivide a cluster and it's resources. We deploy objects in a Namespace which helps with resource isolation/organization. 
We can also limit resources to particular Namespaces when looking at CPU, RAM, Storage
A resource can only be in one namespace at a time.
Some objects in K8s are Namespaced, while some others are not. 
Namespaced = Pods, Controllers, Services
Not Namespaced = PersistentVolumes, Nodes

To check resources that can be part of a namespace
# kubectl api-resources --namespaced=true  (false for the opposite)

- imperative: 	# kubectl create namespace playground1
		# kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --namespace playground1
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: playgroundinyaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: playgroundinyaml

- declarative: # kubectl apply -f Namespace.yaml




default Namespace = default when no Namespace is specified
kube-public Namespace = created automatically and used to share objects across the entire cluster for all users eg: configMaps are here
kube-system Namespace = system Namespace where we find objects like etcd
We also have the option of defining a user defined Namespace imperatively or declaratively.

- Labels: when you want to act on an object or groups of objects
- Annotations: when you want to add a bit more information or metadata about a particular resource
