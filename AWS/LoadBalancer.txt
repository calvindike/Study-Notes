Application Load Balancer for web servers
To use different ports, make sure both ports on different instances will be service same webpage else loadbalancer will be showing different websites on every refresh
Another way will be to limit port activity using Security Group to the port you want

- Create EC2 'nginx-web' with userdata of what you want in the template
- Login and check to be sure to enable applications needed. (Change nginx port to 8080 and restart nginx service - $ netstat -plant to confirm nginx is listening on 8080)
- Shutdown EC2 'nginx-web'
- Create AMI from stopped EC2 with Name = 'nginx-web-AMI'
- Restart stopped EC2 Instance 'nginx-web'
- Create Launch Template from AMI with Name 'nginx-web-LT'
- Launch Instance from Launch Template (Make sure to change Resource name to a different name which will be the name of your EC2)
- Create Target Group with name
- Give Target Group name 'nginx-web-TG' and click Advanced Health check settings
- Override to select custom port (8080 in our nginx case) - next
- Select available EC2 instances that we want to be a part of this target group.
- Add ports 80,8080 as ports for selected instances
- click on 'Include as pending below' (this will generate 4 entries for our 2 servers with 2 ports each) - Create target group
- Go to Load Balancers - Create Load Balancer 'nginx-web-LB'
- Select VPC and your availability zones (All zones in region for high availability)
- Create Security Group for Load Balancer 'nginx-web-LB-SG' (Right click on Create new security group and open in new tab)
- For Inbound rules add 4 entries for port 80 and 8080 TCP with source from anywhere(ipv4 and ipv6 for both ports) for Loadbalancer Security Group
- Go back to page where we were creating Application Load Balancers and select our new Security Group
- Add 2 Listener and routing entries for Port 80 and 8080 and select out Target group 'nginx-web-TG' - Create load balancer
- Go to Load balancer landing page, select load balancer and copy the DNS name 'nginx-web-LB-1663307048.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com'
- Go to browser and paste DNS name in URL bar to access either of our instances in out target group 
Load balancer should be working in round robbin where it pick each server on every refresh
